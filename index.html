      Muggle Olympics may have up to 300 events, but the Triwizard Tournament
      only had three tasks... and they were quite enough.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      The rules were simple: each school was represented by a champion, chosen
      by the Goblet of Fire. The champions took part in three punishing tasks to
      win the Triwizard Cup, one thousand Galleons, eternal glory and probably
      eternal bruises.

      The revival of the tournament was made a lot safer by the addition of an
      age limit: only students aged 17 and over could apply. At least, that was
      the plan.
